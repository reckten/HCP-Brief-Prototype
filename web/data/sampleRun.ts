export const SAMPLE_BRIEF = `# HCP Engagement Brief — Cardivex Hypertension Education Initiative

**Brand:** Cardivex (Meridian Therapeutics) [FICTIONAL BRAND — real drug class: ARB/antihypertensive]
**Indication:** Uncontrolled Hypertension in high-cardiovascular-risk patients
**Brief owner:** Brand Marketing — HCP Engagement
**Date:** Q2 2026
**Status:** Draft for cross-functional review

## Campaign Objective
Increase primary-care and cardiology HCP awareness of updated hypertension treatment guidelines and the clinical profile of Cardivex (a fictional ARB) as an option for patients with uncontrolled blood pressure and elevated cardiovascular risk. Initiative is education-led — focused on the point of clinical decision, not promotional conversion.

**Primary success metric:** Rx lift — measurable increase in Cardivex prescribing among engaged HCPs within 90 days of first content exposure, benchmarked against a matched non-exposed control cohort.

## Target Audience
- **Tier 1 (KOL Influence Score ≥ 7.0):** Priority for EHR point-of-care placement.
- **Tier 2 (KOL Score 4.0–6.9):** On-demand CME track.
- **Tier 3 (KOL Score < 4.0):** Exclude from initial wave.
- **Primary:** Internal medicine and family medicine physicians
- **Secondary:** Cardiologists receiving referrals for resistant hypertension
- **MIPS signal:** Prioritize HCPs scoring below national benchmark on MIPS Quality Measure #236

## EHR Trigger Logic
Display at point of clinical decision when:
1. HCP specialty = Internal Medicine OR Family Medicine OR Cardiology
2. Patient encounter includes ICD-10 code I10 (Essential Hypertension)
3. Most recent documented BP > 140/90 mmHg
4. HCP KOL Influence Score ≥ 4.0
5. HCP has not received this card in the prior 7 days
6. HCP has fewer than 20 Cardivex Rx in the past 90 days

## Channel Mix
1. EHR point-of-care messaging — sidebar education card at clinical trigger
2. On-demand CME modules — 10–15 minute accredited video modules
3. Follow-up email — triggered 48 hours after EHR card with no engagement

## Geography
Southeast US — Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina`;

export const samplePlan = `# Execution Plan

## Recommended Engagement Path
- **Primary path:** EHR-triggered point-of-care messaging
- **Secondary path:** On-demand CME modules
- **Rationale:** The EHR-triggered approach reaches HCPs during real-time patient interactions — the optimal moment to drive awareness. CME modules provide supplementary education to reinforce key messages.

## Phased Sequencing

### Phase 1 — Foundational Setup (Weeks 1–4)
- Finalize EHR vendor partnerships and integration requirements
- Contract CME accreditation partner and align on content timeline
- Procure HCP targeting data and KOL influence scores
- Confirm prescribing data partnership for Rx lift measurement

### Phase 2 — Content Development (Weeks 5–10)
- Create EHR sidebar education card content
- Develop on-demand CME module curriculum and assets
- Obtain MLR approval on all content

### Phase 3 — Deployment and Measurement (Weeks 11–24)
- Launch EHR sidebar messaging in priority clinics
- Distribute on-demand CME modules to target HCP audience
- Monitor EHR message engagement and CME completion rates
- Analyze Rx lift impact vs. control group

## Surfaced Ambiguities
- **BP reading data availability:** Unclear whether EHR trigger can reliably surface structured BP values, or if fallback to ICD-10 I10 alone is needed.
- **EHR frequency cap:** Appropriate frequency cap is unclear — compliance guidelines needed.
- **Opt-out mechanism:** Not yet defined. HCPs need control over their experience.
- **Prescribing data partner:** Specific partner and data use agreement not yet determined.`;

export const sampleDelivery = `# Delivery Package

## Audience Definition
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Specialty | Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Cardiology |
| Geography | Southeast US (Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina) |
| Care setting | Outpatient primary care clinics, Multi-specialty groups, Community health centers |
| Illustrative codes | I10 (Essential Hypertension), MIPS Quality Measure #236 |
| Estimated reachable HCPs | [ILLUSTRATIVE] ~15,000 – 20,000 |

## Channel Recommendation
- **Primary:** EHR point-of-care messaging
- **Secondary:** On-demand CME modules
- **Why:** EHR-triggered approach reaches HCPs during real-time patient interactions — optimal moment for clinical decision support.

## Trigger Criteria
- Signal: ICD-10 code I10 (Essential Hypertension) during patient encounter
- BP reading > 140/90 mmHg (structured signal, if available)
- KOL Influence Score ≥ 4.0
- Frequency cap: 1x per week per HCP (pending compliance confirmation)
- Suppression: HCPs with ≥ 20 Cardivex Rx in prior 90 days are excluded
- Fallback: If structured BP data unavailable, trigger on ICD-10 I10 alone

## Content Format
- **EHR card:** 60–90 second sidebar, fair-balance language, ISI reference
- **CME module:** 10–15 minute accredited video, peer-reviewed, neutral tone
- **Follow-up email:** Triggered 48h after EHR card with no engagement

## Out of Scope
- Patient-level targeting or communication
- Rep-delivered detail aids and paid display
- Rx lift measurement (requires separate data partnership and legal review)`;

export const sampleRiskReview = `# Risk Review Memo

## Summary
Multi-channel HCP education initiative for Cardivex (fictional ARB) targeting primary care and cardiology HCPs in the Southeast US. Reasonable objectives with notable compliance risks.

## Flagged Concerns

### Flag 1: Minimum-necessary data use
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Broad geographic region (Southeast US) and multiple specialty types could lead to larger-than-necessary reach. Use of illustrative diagnosis codes adds ambiguity.
- **Recommendation:** Tighten audience to a smaller geographic region and/or single specialty. Use structured BP readings to more precisely trigger point-of-care messaging.

### Flag 2: PHI / PII exposure
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** HCP targeting sourced from licensed third-party vendor mitigates PHI risk. However, MIPS quality measure data for audience prioritization could inadvertently surface patient-level information.
- **Recommendation:** Clearly define permitted use of MIPS data — aggregate only, no patient-level exposure. Confirm data use agreement with HCP data vendor.

### Flag 3: Vague language
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** CME modules described as "educational, peer-to-peer, neutral" without guardrails. Without specifics, content could drift toward promotional messaging.
- **Recommendation:** Establish clear guidelines for CME tone and content. Ensure fair-balance disclosure and ISI references are prominent in all HCP-facing materials.

### Flag 4: Missing guardrails
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** No frequency cap or opt-out mechanism defined for EHR point-of-care messaging. Rx lift measurement requires unresolved data partnership and legal review.
- **Recommendation:** Define frequency cap and opt-out before launch. Confirm Rx lift data partnership before activating that metric.
