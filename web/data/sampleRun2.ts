export const glucavancePlan = `# Execution Plan

> ⚠ **This brief requires significant rework before a production execution plan can be finalized.** The items below represent a conditional plan — each phase is blocked by at least one unresolved issue from the brief.

## Recommended Engagement Path
- **Recommended path:** UNDETERMINED — brief does not provide sufficient information to recommend a primary channel without resolving targeting, trigger logic, and compliance blockers first.

## Escalation Points (Must Resolve Before Phase 1)
1. **Label review:** Confirm with Medical Affairs whether weight management and BMI messaging is supported by the approved Glucavance indication. If not, all messaging must revert to T2D-only framing.
2. **Targeting redesign:** Narrow from "all PCPs nationwide" to a defined specialty + geography segment with KOL tiering. Nationwide targeting without segmentation is not operationally viable.
3. **PHI review:** Legal must confirm whether using patient BMI > 30 as an HCP targeting signal constitutes permissible data use under applicable regulations.
4. **CME independence:** Establish contractual separation between brand team and CME content development. The co-development model as described cannot receive ACCME accreditation.
5. **Measurement plan redesign:** Patient-level outcome tracking (A1c, weight) is impermissible without a specific data use agreement. Redefine metrics around HCP-level engagement signals only.
6. **Timeline reset:** Marketing's 4-week target is not achievable. Minimum realistic timeline with MLR review, EHR configuration, and CME accreditation is 12–16 weeks.

## Conditional Phased Sequencing

### Phase 1 — Remediation (Weeks 1–4, prerequisite)
- Resolve all 6 escalation points above before any production work begins
- Conduct cross-functional brief review: Medical Affairs, Legal, Regulatory, Compliance
- Redefine primary metric (Rx lift vs. engagement rate cannot remain TBD)

### Phase 2 — Foundational Setup (Weeks 5–8, if Phase 1 resolves)
- Finalize EHR vendor selection and trigger criteria
- Establish CME accreditation partner with full independence from brand team
- Confirm HCP data vendor and data use agreement for purchased list

### Phase 3 — Content and Deployment (Weeks 9–16)
- MLR review of all assets
- EHR configuration and QA
- Phased rollout — Tier 1 HCPs first

## Surfaced Ambiguities
- Primary metric undefined — cannot measure campaign success without this decision
- EHR trigger logic completely undefined — no patient signal, no specialty filter, no suppression rule
- Nationwide targeting with no segmentation — operationally unscalable and compliance-risky
- Co-developed CME is a structural conflict, not a minor edit`;

export const glucavanceDelivery = `# Delivery Package

> ⚠ **DRAFT — 5 sections marked UNRESOLVED. This package cannot be finalized until the brief is reworked.**

## Audience Definition
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Specialty | [UNRESOLVED] Brief states "all PCPs" — recommend narrowing to Internal Medicine + Endocrinology |
| Geography | [UNRESOLVED] Nationwide — no prioritization defined |
| Care setting | All outpatient settings — needs segmentation |
| Targeting signal | [UNRESOLVED] Patient BMI > 30 — Legal review required before activation |
| Estimated reachable HCPs | [UNRESOLVED] Cannot estimate without audience segmentation |

## Channel Recommendation
- **EHR point-of-care:** Conditionally recommended as primary — blocked pending trigger criteria definition and vendor selection
- **Email blasts:** Conditionally viable — blocked pending Legal review of purchased list provenance
- **Programmatic display:** Not recommended for HCP-targeted medical education initiatives — low precision, compliance risk
- **CME modules:** Recommended as secondary — blocked pending resolution of co-development independence conflict

## Trigger Criteria
- [UNRESOLVED] No trigger criteria defined in brief
- Recommended minimum: ICD-10 E11 (Type 2 Diabetes) + specialty filter + KOL score threshold
- Patient BMI signal cannot be used until Legal confirms permissibility

## Content Format
- EHR card: [UNRESOLVED] No format specifications provided
- CME module: [UNRESOLVED] Cannot proceed under co-development model — independence required
- Email: Fair-balance and ISI requirements apply

## Out of Scope (Explicit)
- Patient-level outcome tracking (A1c, weight loss) — impermissible without specific data use agreement
- Programmatic display targeting — not appropriate for this initiative type
- 4-week launch timeline — not achievable`;

export const glucavanceRiskReview = `# Risk Review Memo

## Summary
This brief as submitted cannot proceed to production without significant rework. The pipeline has identified **8 flags** — 3 high severity and 1 critical. This is the highest risk profile surfaced in this review cycle.

## Flagged Concerns

### Flag 1: Off-Label Risk *(High)*
- **Category:** Off-label promotion
- **Description:** Weight management and BMI messaging is not confirmed to be within the approved Glucavance label for T2D. Promoting weight loss benefits without label support constitutes off-label promotion.
- **Recommendation:** Medical Affairs must confirm label scope before any content is drafted. If weight messaging is not supported, all references must be removed.

### Flag 2: Overbroad Targeting *(High)*
- **Category:** Minimum-necessary data use
- **Description:** "All primary care physicians in the US" with no KOL tiering, specialty segmentation, or geographic filter represents an imprecise and operationally unscalable audience definition.
- **Recommendation:** Segment to defined specialties (Internal Medicine, Endocrinology) with geographic prioritization and KOL tiering before EHR trigger configuration.

### Flag 3: PHI Exposure via Patient Signal *(High)*
- **Category:** PHI / PII exposure
- **Description:** Using patient BMI > 30 as an HCP targeting signal means patient-level clinical data is being accessed to identify and target physicians. This constitutes indirect PHI use.
- **Recommendation:** Legal must review under applicable regulations before this signal is activated in any trigger logic. Alternative: use specialty code and ICD-10 diagnosis code only.

### Flag 4: CME Independence Violation *(Critical)*
- **Category:** Regulatory compliance
- **Description:** CME modules co-developed with the Glucavance brand team cannot receive ACCME accreditation. This is a structural violation of CME independence standards, not a minor edit.
- **Recommendation:** Establish a contractually independent CME development process. Brand team involvement must be limited to scientific accuracy review only, with no editorial control.

### Flag 5: Impermissible Patient-Level Measurement *(High)*
- **Category:** Data use / PHI
- **Description:** The measurement plan proposes tracking A1c improvement and weight loss outcomes from HCP engagement. This requires patient-level data that is not permissible under standard HCP engagement data agreements.
- **Recommendation:** Redefine all metrics to HCP-level engagement signals: EHR card opens, CME completions, email click-through, Rx lift from licensed prescribing data only.

### Flag 6: Purchased HCP List — Unverified Provenance *(Medium)*
- **Category:** Data governance
- **Description:** The brief references a "purchased HCP list" with no documentation of provenance, permissible use, or opt-out status. Activating this list without Legal review creates liability.
- **Recommendation:** Legal must review data use agreement before any email deployment.

### Flag 7: Timeline Infeasibility *(Medium)*
- **Category:** Operational risk
- **Description:** A 4-week launch target cannot accommodate MLR review cycles (minimum 2–4 weeks), EHR vendor configuration (minimum 4–6 weeks), or CME accreditation (minimum 8–12 weeks).
- **Recommendation:** Reset timeline expectations with marketing leadership. Minimum realistic timeline is 12–16 weeks with a Phase 1 remediation period.

### Flag 8: Missing Guardrails *(Medium)*
- **Category:** Compliance controls
- **Description:** No frequency cap, opt-out mechanism, or suppression logic defined anywhere in the brief. These are required compliance controls before any live HCP-facing placement.
- **Recommendation:** Define all three before any channel goes live.
