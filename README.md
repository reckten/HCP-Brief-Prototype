# HCP Brief Workflow Demo

**🔗 Live demo: [hcp-brief-demo.vercel.app](https://hcp-brief-demo.vercel.app)**

A 6-stage agentic pipeline that reads a structured HCP engagement brief in markdown and produces a complete, traceable, compliance-reviewed delivery package — requirements, execution plan, delivery handoff, QA test plan, risk review, and a calibrated evaluation score.

## Why This Is Relevant to Relevate Health

Relevate Health operates at the intersection of HCP engagement, omnichannel activation, and data-driven precision targeting — including EHR point-of-care placement, KOL influence scoring, Rx lift measurement, and next-best-action sequencing. This prototype mirrors those patterns in pipeline form:

- **Structured intake** of unstructured brand briefs → validated requirements JSON
- **KOL tier logic**, MIPS quality measure targeting, and EHR trigger criteria parsed and surfaced automatically
- **Compliance and risk review** as a dedicated agent stage, not an afterthought
- **AgentOps-style observability** — per-stage timing, token usage, and status in `trace.json`
- **Calibrated evaluation scoring** across five quality dimensions with human-review flags

This is adjacent prototype work — not a representation of any internal Relevate process. The brand (Cardivex / Meridian Therapeutics) and indication (fictional ARB for hypertension) are illustrative. No real PHI, no real HCP data.

Each agent is a single focused LLM call. Prompts live in `prompts/` as plain markdown — editable without touching TypeScript. The pipeline is sequential; a stage failure halts the run with upstream artifacts preserved.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js (ESM) + TypeScript |
| Execution | `tsx` — runs TS directly, no compile step |
| AI API | Claude 3 Haiku via OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible) |
| Schema validation | Zod |
| Observability | Custom AgentOps-style tracer → `trace.json` |
| Reporting | Self-contained `report.html` — no framework, no bundler |
| Testing | Vitest (ESM-native) |
| Config | `dotenv` |

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- An OpenRouter API key (free tier works; paid Haiku tier recommended for full 6-stage runs)

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY to .env
```

### Run
```bash
npm run demo
# or: npx tsx src/index.ts briefs/sample-brief.md
```

Artifacts land in `runs/<run-id>/`. Open `report.html` in a browser for the visual summary.

### Test
```bash
npm test          # 10 unit tests — schema, tracer, fs helpers
npm run typecheck
```

---

## Sample Run

A pre-generated run ships in `runs/sample-run/` — no API key required to review outputs:

```bash
ls runs/sample-run/
# delivery-package.md   eval.json     plan.md
# requirements.json     risk-review.md  summary.md
# test-plan.md          trace.json
```

Start with `runs/sample-run/summary.md` for a plain-English overview.

## Artifact Guide

| File | Stage | What it contains |
|---|---|---|
| `requirements.json` | Intake | Zod-validated structured extraction. Empty fields = honest gap signal. |
| `plan.md` | Planner | Phased execution plan with surfaced ambiguities. |
| `delivery-package.md` | Delivery | Operational handoff: audience table, trigger criteria, suppression rules, out-of-scope. |
| `test-plan.md` | QA | 8 test categories: happy path, incomplete brief, conflicting criteria, overbroad audience, wrong channel, missing compliance, edge cases, adversarial. |
| `risk-review.md` | Compliance | Severity-ranked flags with recommendations. |
| `eval.json` | Evaluator | 0–1 scores across 5 dimensions + human-review flags array. |
| `trace.json` | All stages | Per-stage timing, token counts, status, retries — AgentOps observability surface. |
| `summary.md` | Pipeline | Plain-English run summary for non-technical stakeholders. |
| `report.html` | Pipeline | Self-contained visual report. Open directly in browser. |

## Sample Brief

The included brief (`briefs/sample-brief.md`) simulates a real HCP engagement initiative:

- **Brand:** Cardivex (fictional ARB / Meridian Therapeutics)
- **Indication:** Uncontrolled hypertension in high-cardiovascular-risk patients
- **Trigger logic:** ICD-10 I10 + BP > 140/90 + KOL Influence Score ≥ 4.0
- **Channels:** EHR point-of-care sidebar → on-demand CME → 48h follow-up email
- **Targeting:** MIPS Quality Measure #236, Southeast US, primary care + cardiology
- **Primary metric:** Rx lift ≥ 12% at 90 days vs. matched control cohort

---

## Known Limitations

- **No structured outputs.** JSON is extracted via regex. Production would use the SDK's tool-use contract.
- **No human-in-the-loop checkpoint.** Compliance flags are generated but there is no reviewer sign-off gate before the evaluator runs.
- **Self-graded evaluation.** Scores are not calibrated against a labeled human-review set.
- **No persistent run store.** Runs are written to local disk only.
- **No streaming.** Each stage waits for the full response before the next begins.
